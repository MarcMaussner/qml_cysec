# qml_cysec
cybersecurity aspects in quantum machine learning

## List of cybersecurity attacks for experimentsc
- Crosstalk:
  - create proof of concept with noisy backend -> try to flip one possible qubit
  - create proof of concept qml -> learn logic gates?
  - create real world qml (MNIST, CISAF10),...
- Transpilation:
  - reuse qiskit transpiler passes to insert X-Gates on purpose of circuit transpilation

## Conferences:
- Embedded World 2025
- GI Workshop Quantum 2025
- QTML 2025
- QCE 2025

## Timeline:
- 18.10.2024: Kickoff
  - Gather list of possible attacks
  - Gather list of conferences
- 29.10.2024: FollowUp
  - Think about list extension
  - Present current state of proof of concepts (noisy backend, transpilation)
